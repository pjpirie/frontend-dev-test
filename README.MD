Waracle Developer Test (CAT API).

A simple website that is built by and for cat â™¥'ers.

### Tech Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

## Getting Started

### Executing program

This project was built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) in place of create-react-app.
However, I belive the files can be run in any react development environment.

```
//Using vite
npm run dev
```

```
//Using create-react-app
npm run start
```
