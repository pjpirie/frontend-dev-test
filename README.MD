# Waracle Developer Test (CAT API).

[Live Demo](https://waracle.paulpirie.com/)

## Description

A simple website that is built by and for cat â™¥'ers.

### Tech Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

## Getting Started

### Executing program

This project was built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) in place of create-react-app.
However, I belive the files can be run in any react development environment.

```
//Using vite
npm run dev
```

```
//Using create-react-app
npm run start
```
